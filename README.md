# Personal Website
> This is my first coding project and experience in the magical world of computer language.
Everything that you are going to see is based on the knowledge that I‚Äôve acquired until this moment.
My promise is to keep learning new thing in order to offer more detailed and interactive works!

## Overview 
### Why did you created this? üßê
I wanted to make practice with all the skills and knowledge acquired in the online course that I‚Äôve followed. 

This is also a good opportunity to create something different from the usual CV template that you see on the internet. In this case everything is interactive and I‚Äôve put some projects created in these years to show other different skills that I can apply on different fields, related to the world of digital jobs (like UI/UX design, graphic design). 


### What it does? :question:
Like it‚Äôs specified in the title, this is a personal website where I show my skills with coding, user interface rules and graphic design. 
This is not just a website that you can explore and navigate through like the usual website on the internet, but it‚Äôs also another way to present myself to companies, I like to think about it like an interactive curriculum vitae.
