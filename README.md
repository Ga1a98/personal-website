# Personal Website
> [!NOTE]
> This is my first coding experience in the magical world of computer language.
Everything that you are going to see is based on the knowledge that I’ve acquired until this moment.
My promise is to keep learning new things in order to offer more detailed and interactive works!

## Overview 
### Why did you created this? 💭
I wanted to make practice with all the **skills and knowledge** acquired in the online course that I’ve followed. 

This is also a good opportunity to create something different from the usual CV template that you see on internet. In this case everything is interactive.
I’ve put some projects created through these years to show different skills applied on different fields related to the world of digital jobs like, UI/UX design, graphic design. 


### What it does? 🤔
Like it’s specified in the title, this is a **personal website** where I show my skills with coding, user interface rules and graphic design. 
This is not just a website that you can explore and navigate through like the usual websites, but it’s also another way to present myself to others. I like to think about it like an **interactive curriculum vitae**!



## Languages
### What programming languages did you use? 🤖
Considering that I’m a beginner, I’ve used: 
+ **HTML** for the base structure of the website and every other page related to its categories. I’ve also implemented the **Bootstrap framework** for every page because it was easier for me to create a responsive website with that grid structure.

- **CSS** for the styling part. I’ve also compiled the css stylesheet into **SASS** for an easier use of the variables.

* **GIT** for saving all the changes and sending the repository here, on _GitHub_.



## Structure 
The structure is very simple. The **landing page** (**home**) contains the main informaton that give to the user an hint about what I want to communicate. Every section has one or more buttons related that can lead the user to another page with more information, like previous project or my CV. 
The **sticky navigation bar** at the top of the page is the key to go back and forth between pages inside the website.
Here's a preview about the entire parts of the website and how the user will move inside the various pages:

### - Home 🏠
Here you can see there’s an alternation between images, text parts and white space. I’ve made it like this specifically to deliver useful information ”step by step” and let the curiosity lead the use to explore where it feels necessary or interesting.

The click on buttons like the one in ”**About me**” section, and those related for each of the three cards in the "**My Projects**" section, are essential to discover more curiosities and details about every aspect.

### - Contact me ✉️
Every user can have access to this section immediately from the navigation bar at the top of the page, and is always visible. 
There’s the usual **form** with its related **form fields** to fill with personal information, useful in case someone wants to collaborate or know more facts about a specific topic.

### - Resume 📎
You can access this page from the ”**About me**” section. The **Resume** page is created entirely with HTML and CSS (like the entire website) and it's a detailed biography about my previous jobs, my skills and my education. 

### - Projects :
After the click on the button presented in each of the three carsd, you can see its related page with some cards combined with an image and a short text. This immediately gives to the user and idea about what is the project’s topic and, maybe, lead the person to discover even more by clicking on the ”**View PDF project**” button.

This will open the entire explanation of the project with more in depth details.
