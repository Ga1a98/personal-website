# Personal Website
> This is my first coding project and experience in the magical world of computer language.
Everything that you are going to see is based on the knowledge that I’ve acquired until this moment.
My promise is to keep learning new thing in order to offer more detailed and interactive works!

## Overview 
### Why did you created this? 💭
I wanted to make practice with all the **skills and knowledge** acquired in the online course that I’ve followed. 

This is also a good opportunity to create something different from the usual CV template that you see on the internet. In this case everything is interactive and I’ve put some projects created in these years to show other different skills that I can apply on different fields, related to the world of digital jobs (like UI/UX design, graphic design). 


### What it does? 🤔
Like it’s specified in the title, this is a **personal website** where I show my skills with coding, user interface rules and graphic design. 
This is not just a website that you can explore and navigate through like the usual website on the internet, but it’s also another way to present myself to companies, I like to think about it like an interactive curriculum vitae.

## Languages
### What programming languages did you use? 👾
Considering that I’m a beginner, I’ve used: 
+ **HTML** for the base structure of the website and every other page related to its categories. I’ve also implemented the **Bootstrap framework** for every page because it was easier for me to create a responsive website with its grid structure.

- **CSS** or the styling part, but only in a small way because, as I said before, the Bootstrap components are present in the entire project. I’ve also compiled the css stylesheet into **SASS** for an easier use of the variables.

* **GIT** for saving all the changes and sending the repository here, on _GitHub_.


### Structure 👷‍♀️
The structure is very simple. The **landing page** (**home**) contains the main sections that can give to the user an hint about what I want to communicate. Every section has one or more buttons related that can lead the user to another page with more information, like previous project that I’ve made or my CV. 
The **sticky navigation bar** at the top of the page is the key to go back and forth between pages inside the website.
Here's a preview about the entire parts of the website and how the user will move inside the various pages:

### Home
Here you can see there’s an alternation between images, text parts and white space. I’ve made it specifically to deliver useful information ”step by step” to the user and let the curiosity lead the exploration where it feels necessary or interesting.

The click on buttons, like the one in ”**About me**” section and those related for each of the three cards, are essential to discover more curiosities about every aspect presented in the previous page.

### Contact me
Every user can have access to this section immediately from the navigation bar, at the top of the page and is always visible, thanks to the sticky nav bar component. 
There’s the usual **form** with its related **form fields** to fill with personal information, useful in case someone wants to collaborate or have more information about a specific topic.
